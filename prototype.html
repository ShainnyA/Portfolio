        Driver drowsiness is a significant safety concern that can lead to serious accidents on 
        the road where the term ‘Driver drowsiness’ refers to the state of impaired alertness and 
        reduced ability to concentrate that is caused by fatigue or sleep deprivation. When a 
        driver is drowsy, their ability to react to changing driving conditions and make quick 
        decisions is significantly reduced, which can lead to dangerous situations on the road.<br><br>
        This report describes a driver drowsiness detection system that utilizes an eye blink 
        sensor to monitor the driver's level of fatigue. Drowsy driving contributes to a large 
        number of road accidents every year. To mitigate this problem, the proposed system 
        tracks the driver's eye blink rate to detect drowsiness and alert the driver through an
        audible alarm.<br><br>
        An eye blink sensor plays a crucial role in detecting driver drowsiness by monitoring the 
        driver's eye blink rate. The sensor is usually placed near the driver's eye, and it uses 
        infrared light to detect eye movements and changes in the blink rate.<br><br>
        When a person is drowsy, their eye blink rate tends to decrease, and their blinks 
        become longer and more irregular. By analyzing these changes in the blink rate, the eye 
        blink sensor can determine the driver's level of fatigue and alert them when necessary.
        Eye blink sensors are becoming an increasingly popular method for detecting driver 
        drowsiness because they are non-invasive and can be easily integrated into existing 
        safety systems in cars. By providing early warning signs of drowsiness, the sensor can 
        help drivers take appropriate measures to avoid accidents, such as taking breaks, 
        adjusting their driving behavior, or pulling over to rest.<br><br>
        In conclusion, the driver drowsiness detection system using an eye blink sensor is a 
        promising approach to improve road safety. By providing early warning signs of 
        drowsiness, the system can alert the driver to take appropriate measures to avoid 
        accidents. Further research could explore additional methods of detecting driver fatigue 
        and integrating them into existing safety systems to further improve road safety.
